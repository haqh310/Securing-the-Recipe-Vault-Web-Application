# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
    - Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
    - No, VPC private endpoints for S3 alone may not fully secure access to the bucket if the IAM permissions for the bucket itself are misconfigured.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
    - All of the original security risks would be back.
